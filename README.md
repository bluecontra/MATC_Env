# MATC_Env
Multi-agent Trash Collecting (MATC) domains used in research paper [Hierarchical Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (arXiv:1809.09332)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09332).

A series of grid-world environments including:
  1) Classic coodination games
  2) Classic coodination games (stochastic)
  3) Climbing games (deterministic/partical uncertain/fully uncertain)
  4) Four rooms
  5) MATC_Room
  6) MATC_Ring

You are free to fork and modify the envs for research purposes.
